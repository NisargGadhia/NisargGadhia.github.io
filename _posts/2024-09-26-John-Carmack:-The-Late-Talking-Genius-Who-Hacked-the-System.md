Ever heard of a 15-month-old who refuses to talk, then suddenly drops a full sentence like, “Here’s your loofah, Daddy”? Yep, that was John Carmack, a kid who clearly had better things to say than just baby talk. His parents were concerned until that moment—then they knew they had someone extraordinary on their hands.

Growing up in a house where learning was a big deal, John wasn’t your typical kid. His dad, a math and engineering whiz, became a news anchor, and his mom was a microbiologist. So yeah, the bar was set pretty high for little John—who was already scoring 9th-grade level on tests by second grade! Despite his insane smarts, John didn’t exactly have an easy time. He clashed with his mom over her super strict rules (like padlocking his comic books). Once, when she locked them away, John just took the door off its hinges. Savage.

At school, he found his escape through Dungeons & Dragons and fantasy novels. But what really changed his life? The day he discovered computers. He was hooked. From hacking games to learning to code, John realized that with computers, he could create worlds.

But not everything was sunshine and rainbows. His parents divorced, and Carmack had to bounce between schools and homes. Things got rocky, but then he found his people—fellow rebels who were just as into hacking and computers as he was. Together, they explored the underground world of BBSs (basically the internet before the internet) and, well, made things explode. Literally. Carmack and his crew even tried to use homemade explosives to break into a school and steal Apple II computers. Not his best decision—he got caught and ended up in juvie for a year.

But instead of that holding him back, it only fueled his passion for computers even more. John Carmack went on to become one of the most legendary programmers, creating iconic games like Doom and Quake. This is a guy who turned hacking from a rebellious pastime into a groundbreaking career.

If there’s one thing to take away from Carmack’s story: don’t let anyone box you in. Whether it's strict parents, school rules, or society’s expectations, sometimes breaking the mold (maybe not literally breaking windows) is how you find your path.
