Imagine being an eleven-year-old boy in 1979, riding your dirt bike through the quiet streets of Rocklin, California. The warm summer air whips past as you pedal toward a place you know you shouldn’t be—yet you can’t resist the pull. The Roundtable Pizza Parlor isn’t just a hangout; it’s a portal to another world, where the greatest challenge isn’t your stepfather’s wrath, but the high scores on the arcade machine.

John Romero, a scrawny kid with thick glasses, knew all too well that he was courting trouble. His stepfather, a former drill sergeant with strict rules and a fierce temper, had made it clear: stay away from the arcades. But for Romero, the allure of Asteroids was impossible to ignore. The game was legendary, the coolest on Earth as far as he was concerned, and the thrill of dodging meteors in a pixelated spaceship was worth any punishment that might come his way.

Romero wasn’t just good at the game—he dominated it. His initials, AJR, were a constant on the leaderboard, a testament to hours of play and an unyielding determination to be the best. But as he slipped a quarter into the machine and the familiar Jaws-like music began, Romero’s triumph was cut short. A heavy hand clamped down on his shoulder, and before he could react, his face smashed into the screen.
His stepfather had found him.

Dragged out of the pizza parlor and thrown into a pickup truck, Romero knew what was coming. His stepfather’s fury was palpable, and as they drove home, the older man’s words cut deep. By the time they reached the house, Romero’s fate was sealed—a fat lip, a black eye, and two weeks grounded. But even as the pain throbbed and the punishment loomed, the games called to him. The very next day, he was back at the arcade.

Romero’s resilience was born out of hardship. He’d been a fighter since birth, a premature baby who grew up in a household that teetered on the edge of chaos. His father, Alfonso, was a hard-drinking, hard-living man who eventually abandoned the family. His mother, Ginny, remarried, and his stepfather tried to step into the role of father figure, but their relationship was a complicated mix of encouragement and brutal discipline.

Despite the turmoil at home, Romero found solace in his talents. He was a gifted artist, and his drawings caught his stepfather’s attention early on. For a time, they bonded over Romero’s love of arcade games, with his stepfather even taking him to local competitions. But as Romero’s obsession with gaming grew, so did the tension at home. His grades slipped, and his stepfather’s patience wore thin.

Then came the day that changed everything—a day when Romero’s brother, Ralph, and a friend burst into the house with news that would ignite a passion that would define his life. They’d discovered a new kind of game at Sierra College, a game that didn’t require quarters or high scores but was instead a journey into an alternate reality. It was called Colossal Cave Adventure, and it was played on strange, hulking computers.

For Romero, this was a revelation. The computer lab became his new sanctuary, a place where he could escape the pressures of home and school and immerse himself in a world where he was in control. The students at the lab took him under their wing, teaching him the basics of programming. Soon, he was creating his own games, his imagination fueled by a combination of comic books, video games, and a desire to prove himself.

But the path wasn’t easy. His stepfather didn’t understand his obsession with computers and dismissed it as a waste of time. The fights escalated, but so did Romero’s determination. He was a quick learner, mastering the language of programming and diving deeper into the world of game development. Despite the setbacks, the lost grades, and the physical punishments, Romero’s passion for gaming only grew stronger.

He began to channel his frustrations into his creations, drawing grotesque comics that shocked his teachers and pouring his energy into coding. By the time he got his hands on an Apple II computer, he was ready to take his game development to the next level. The Apple II, with its accessibility and potential, was the perfect tool for Romero’s burgeoning talent. As he learned the ropes, the vision of his future began to take shape—a future where he wasn’t just a player, but a creator of worlds.

Romero’s journey from a troubled kid sneaking into arcades to a budding game developer was a story of resilience, creativity, and the unyielding drive to escape into a world of his own making.
