In the early days of computing, two childhood friends, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, were busy laying the groundwork for what would become a revolution in personal computing. Wozniak, affectionately known as Woz, was a brilliant programmer with a mischievous side. He was the mastermind behind quirky inventions like a dial-a-joke phone number and a video game that humorously displayed “Oh Shit” on the screen when a player lost. Jobs, with his entrepreneurial vision, saw potential in Woz’s talents and enlisted him to design Breakout, a game for Atari. This collaboration led to the birth of Apple, a company that would soon change the world.

In 1976, they released their first Apple computer, a prototype aimed at the Homebrew Computer Club crowd. The Apple I was priced at $666.66, a devilishly clever figure. However, it was the Apple II, released the following year, that truly captured the mass market. With a keyboard, BASIC compatibility, and color graphics, the Apple II was a game-changer. It lacked a hard drive, but it came with two game paddles, emphasizing its purpose—gaming.

Enter John Romero, a young enthusiast who first encountered the Apple II at Sierra College. While mainframe computers were limited to displaying white blocks and lines, the Apple II’s monitor exploded with color and high-resolution graphics. Romero was instantly captivated. He spent hours playing the increasingly diverse lineup of games available on the Apple II, from rip-offs of arcade hits like Asteroids and Space Invaders to innovative titles like Ultima.

Richard Garriott, also known as Lord British, was the creative genius behind the Ultima series. His games, though graphically crude with blocky representations of landscapes and characters, offered a novelistic and participatory experience that captivated players. Garriott, like many other early programmers, demonstrated the entrepreneurial spirit of the era by hand-distributing his games on floppy disks in clear plastic Ziploc bags to local computer stores.

Romero, too, was drawn to this burgeoning culture of game development. His stepfather, recognizing Romero’s obsession, decided to bring a computer home, hoping to keep a closer eye on him. The day the Apple II arrived, Romero was already deep into assembling it, much to his stepfather’s initial dismay. However, upon seeing Romero engrossed in his new machine, his stepfather’s anger subsided, and he allowed Romero to show him some games.

Christmas of 1982 marked a turning point for Romero. His two requests were for books on Apple Graphics and assembly language, both of which became his lifeblood. When his stepfather’s job took the family to a Royal Air Force base in Alconbury, England, Romero dove deeper into game development, refining his skills in assembly language and creating his own artwork and packaging. He began selling his games at school, earning a reputation for his talents.

Romero’s stepfather became aware of his son’s growing reputation when an officer working on a classified Russian dogfight simulation asked if Romero might be interested in a part-time job. The officer led Romero into a cold room filled with large computers, where he was tasked with translating a program from a mainframe to a minicomputer. Romero, unfazed by the challenge, confidently replied, “No problem. I know everything about games.”

As home computers gained popularity and video game consoles experienced a crash in the early 1980s, the demand for computer games surged. Romero, armed with his Apple II, found two main paths to publication: through big publishers like Sierra and Electronic Arts, or through enthusiast magazines that printed games as code for readers to input manually. Romero chose the latter, spending every spare moment in front of his Apple II, creating games for publication. His grades suffered, sparking conflicts with his stepfather, but Romero’s passion for game development only grew stronger.

In 1984, after eight months of rejections, Romero received his first acceptance letter from an Apple magazine called InCider. They agreed to publish the code for his game Scout Search, a low-resolution maze game where players, represented by dots, had to gather their scouts before being attacked by a grizzly bear. Although the graphics were simple, the game was fun, and Romero was paid $100 for his work. This success spurred Romero to create more games, each with catchy, alliterative titles like Alien Attack and Cavern Crusader. His confidence soared as he continued to win programming contests and see his games published in magazines.

Despite his growing success, Romero’s personal life was tumultuous. After reconnecting with his biological father, he proudly updated him on his accomplishments, signing his letters with titles like “Ace Programmer, Contest Winner, Future Rich Person.” However, to truly achieve his dreams, Romero knew he needed to return to America.

In 1986, Romero’s wish came true when his family moved back to California. He enrolled in classes at Sierra College and continued to publish games at a rapid pace. His games graced magazine covers, and his reputation as a skilled programmer grew. While working at Burger King, Romero met Kelly Mitchell, the daughter of a well-off Mormon family. The two quickly fell in love, and in 1987, they were married.

Romero was now determined to land his dream job. He had published ten games, was about to graduate from high school, and had a new family to support. His opportunity came at Applefest, a gathering for Apple computer enthusiasts. There, Romero met Jay Wilbur, an editor at Uptime magazine, who offered him a job. Romero, ever confident, told Jay he’d think about it.

At the convention, Romero also impressed the team at Origin Systems, the creators of the Ultima series, with his programming skills. They, too, offered him a job. Two months later, Romero found himself driving across the country to start work at Origin’s office in New Hampshire. He was excited, though financially strapped, writing hot checks to cover toll booth fees. His wife, Kelly, was less enthusiastic about moving to the snow-covered state, but Romero assured her that their future was bright.

However, things didn’t go as planned. Despite initial success at Origin, Romero’s decision to join a startup company with his boss proved disastrous. The startup failed, leaving Romero, now a father of two, out of work and sleeping on a friend’s couch. But Romero refused to give up. He had a dream to pursue and a family to support.

Romero reached out to Jay Wilbur, who suggested he join him at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana. With little hesitation, Romero agreed. He was ready to chase his dreams, believing that Shreveport held the promise of new opportunities and the chance to be among the most dedicated gamers in the industry.
