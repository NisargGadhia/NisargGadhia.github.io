The Two Jones:

A blog series diving deep into the iconic partnership between John Carmack and John Romero, two of the most influential figures in video game history. Based on the riveting biography Masters of Doom by David Kushner, this series will explore how these two visionaries not only shaped the gaming world but redefined the cultural landscape.

From their meteoric rise to creating legendary titles like Doom and Quake, to the unraveling of their partnership, we’ll uncover what made their collaboration both groundbreaking and combustible. Through a mix of technical genius, creative flair, and sheer willpower, John and John forever changed the way we play, think, and experience games.

Join me as we explore their personal stories, their shared triumphs, and their lasting legacy on an industry that continues to evolve. Whether you’re a game developer, a player, or someone fascinated by the blend of art and technology, The Two Johns will offer insights into the magic behind the pixels and the minds that mastered them.
